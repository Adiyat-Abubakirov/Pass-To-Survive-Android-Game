Project name: Pass to Survive

First and last name of the Author: Adiyat Abubakirov, high school student

Background: So, this is a project that I made when I was 13 years old. At that point, I took a course of Mobile Application Development, teached by one of the Samsung departments "Samsung Innovation Campus". At the end of the course, I had to make a game so this is that game. 

Project description:
- This game is a platformer which has 2 levels, and 2 skins for the player model. The first skins is pretty basic and the second skin is character from one of my favorite Japanese series, it is automatically placed on the playerâ€™s model after 20 deaths in the game. It was added to the game as easter egg. Levels are divided into two parts with smooth transitions. Everything in this game is animated except static objects of worlds. There are two different "Game Over" screens and two different "Win" screens. After completing one level, player will be prompted to complete another one. The game works in native resolution and native refresh rate of the phone. The game was tested on Pixel 1, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy Fold and some old devices. The game works perfectly on phones with android 7 and higher.
- I used LibGDX (game engine for Android Studio based on java) to implement gravity, jumping, bouncing and etc. In LibGDX, there is vector classes for vector quantities, such as force. In the course, there was no tutorials for game developing. The course was just teaching how to develop apps. So, I did a self-study of LibGDX in order to implement it into my project.
- Some assets were taken from internet, some other were made myself using Adobe Photoshop.
- If you want more deep explanation of how game works, I included comments in the project code and more explanation in PowerPoint presentation which is located here and common app.
- There is also gameplay video located in same places as PowerPoint presentation. The video shows parts of each world, all "Game Over" screens and "Win" screens, so that's why in some moments, screen suddenly changes. It doesn't show second skin. The video has bad quality in some moments, but the actual game looks much better.
- I also included apk file for you to try the game on android device, it is also located in the same places as video and presentation. The game only works on android phones, because I made it in program called Android Studio which is made only for android development.
