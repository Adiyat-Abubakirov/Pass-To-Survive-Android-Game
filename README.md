Background:
So, this is a project that I made when I was 13 years old. At that point, I took a course of Mobile Application Development, teached by one of the Samsung departments "Samsung Innovation Campus".
At the end of the course, I had to make either Mobile app or a game for android devices. So, I chose a game and this is the game that I made at the end of the course.

Project description:
- This game is a platformer. I used libGDX (game engine for Android Studio) to implement gravity, jumping, bouncing and etc. In libGDX, there is vector classes for vector quantities, such as force.
In the course, there was no tutorials for game developing. So, I did a self-study of libGDX in order to implement it into my project.
- Some assets were taken from internet, some other were made by myself using Adobe Photoshop.
- I included comments in project code and more explanation in pptx file.
- In the folder of project, there is also gameplay video. Unfortunately, there is no sound, because video editor doesn't work properly, but the game has sound.
- I also included apk file for you to try the game on android device.
